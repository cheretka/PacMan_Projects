# PacMan Projects
The PacMan projects were developed for CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing PacMan.

# Project 1: Search
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa20/project1/

In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.



# Project 2: Multi-Agent Search
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa20/project2/

In this project, I designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, I implemented both minimax and expectimax search and try hand at evaluation function design.
